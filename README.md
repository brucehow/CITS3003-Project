## Overview
This code covers the CITS3003: Graphics and Animation 2019 Project at UWA. 
The code implementation for this Project is for Mac OSX only.

[Part 1 specification](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3003/labsheet.php?fname=project-2019/project-part1)
Part 1 of the project has 60 marks and will be assessed on correctness of the functionalities and coding (structure, clarity and appropriate use of OpenGL). Task A carries 7 marks and tasks B to I carry 6 marks each. The last 5 marks are researved for the report. This equals the 60 marks allocated to part 1. You can get upto 5 bonus marks by optionally completing task J.

[Part 2 specification](http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3003/labsheet.php?fname=project-2019/project-part2)
Part 2 of the project has 40 marks. You are expected to produce at least three animated human models in your program. The 3D human models can be produced by MakeHuman software and animation by Blender. You are suggested to follow the instructions given below and also take help from online tutorials when needed. You should export your animated model from blender and add it to your scene editor. When a user adds the animated model to the scene, it should perform the animation automatically. Some sample code and instructions are supplied to help you accomplish these tasks.
